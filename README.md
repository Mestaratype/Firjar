**Firjar**  is a contemporary Kufic-inspired and minimalist bilingual typeface, covering both Arabic and Latin scripts with precision and harmony. Its name, meaning compass in Arabic, reflects its design philosophy of guidance and balance.

The concept of Firjar draws from the structure of a compass, built using quarter-circle curves combined with clean, straight lines. The type family spans a wide range of styles — from condensed to extended widths and from thin to black weights — making it highly versatile for bold headlines, branding, user interfaces, editorial design, and display applications.


## Variable Font Axes

Firjar is also a variable font built with:

| Axis | Tag | Range | Default | Static Instances |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Weight | wght | 100 to 900 | 400 | Thin, ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Black |
| Width | wdth | 75 to 125 | 100 | Condensed, SemiCondensed, Regular, SemiExpanded, Expanded |

#### `wght` (Weight) Axis
The `wght` axis spans Thin (100) to Black (900).
