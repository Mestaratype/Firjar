**Firjar**  is a contemporary Kufic-inspired and minimalist bilingual typeface, covering both Arabic and Latin scripts with precision and harmony. Its name means compass in Arabic. The naming reflects the typeface design philosophy of flexibility and balance.

The concept of Firjar design is inspired by the compass’s capabilities, which are designed using quarter-circled curves combined with clean straight lines.

## Variable Font Axes

The typeface spans a wide range of styles, from condensed to extended widths and from thin to black weights, making it highly versatile for bold headlines, branding, user interfaces, editorial design, and display applications.

Firjar has the following axes:

| Axis | Tag | Range | Default | Static Instances |

| Width | wdth | 75 to 125 | 100 | Condensed, SemiCondensed, Regular, SemiExpanded, Expanded |

#### `wght` (Weight) Axis

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at (https://mestaratype.github.io/Firjar/).
