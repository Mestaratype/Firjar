Firjar is a contemporary Kufic-inspired and minimalist bilingual typeface, covering both Arabic and Latin scripts with precision and harmony. Its name, meaning compass in Arabic, reflects its design philosophy of guidance and balance.

The concept of Firjar draws from the structure of a compass, built using quarter-circle curves combined with clean, straight lines. The type family spans a wide range of styles — from condensed to extended widths and from thin to black weights — making it highly versatile for bold headlines, branding, user interfaces, editorial design, and display applications.


## Variable Font Axes

Firjar is also a variable font built with:

Axis | Tag | Range | Default | Static Instances
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Weight | wght | 100 to 900 | 400 | Thin, ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Black
Width | wdth | 75 to 120 | 100 | Condensed, Regular, Expanded

#### `wght` (Weight) Axis

The `wght` axis spans Thin (100) to Black (900).

## Building

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

* `make build` will produce font files.
* `make test` will run [FontBakery](https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery)'s quality assurance tests.
* `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at `https://mestaratype.github.io/Firjar/`.
